# Mod4Project
Movie Recommendation System

# Goal
The goal of this project is to recomended movies. I have created a model to predict what movie a user would like,
what the user would rate movies, and a model that gives you similar movies based on the genre. 

#Target
The target of the model is to give a user movies based on their ratings and preferences. I have also implemented a way that gives
a user his top 5 mosst recomended animation movies. 

#Predictors
The only data used for this project was movie lens small data set found here: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest
This model only uses the genre of a given movie along with the users rated movies. 

# Data Cleaning
Data did not need to be cleaned heavily. Genres had to be split for preprocessing and the lenght of the ratings was above one hundred thousand.
Used twenty-five percent of the due to the lack of processing power.
